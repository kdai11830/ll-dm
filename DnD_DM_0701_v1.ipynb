She is tall and athletic, with short brown hair, green eyes, and a determined expression. Clad in chain mail and wielding a longsword, Elara's appearance reflects her readiness for battle. Born in a small village, she was trained by her father, a retired soldier. Driven by a desire to protect the innocent and seek justice, she left home to make her mark on the world.
